        <h3>About License Generator</h3>
        <p id="aboutpara">
            This license generator helps you to generate a simple Checky license for your software/app/ website. Checky license is named after the software <a href="">Checky</a>, which was the first software to be published under this license. <br>
            Checky is a permissive license, which allows most freedoms and rights to users provided by open source software licenses, however, it also protects the rights of the authors, and ensures their work is not exploited. <br>
            <br> To generate this license for your software/ website, simply fill in the options, and the license will be automatically generated for you, so you don't have to do the editing yourself! Copy the license after it has been generated!
